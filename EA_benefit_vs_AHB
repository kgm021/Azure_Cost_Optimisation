What is the difference between EA benefit vs AHB (Azure Hybrid Benefit)?



The EA (Enterprise Agreement) benefit is only available to companies who sign an Enterprise agreement with Microsoft, it typically involves a usage commitment for Azure resources. The higher the commitment, the better the EA discounts.

PayG or other contract types do not have this type of discount, but may have other smaller discounts.



Azure Hybrid Benefit is a "Licensing" benefit. AHB lets you bring your existing on-premises Windows Server and SQL Server licenses with active Software Assurance or subscriptions to Azure.



AHB benefit is applicable for software license cost portion of a VM's cost (Windows, SQL license). The compute cost of a VM is not reduced.

Recently, Microsoft made this benefit available to RedHat and SUSE Linux subscription as well.
