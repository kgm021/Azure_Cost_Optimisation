NEW [Nov-20]: Optimize costs by automating Azure Blob Storage access tiers
Optimize costs by automating Azure Blob Storage access tiers



Microsoft recently released a feature that lets you save on storage costs by automatically archiving of old data.

Azure Blob Storage lifecycle management policy offers the ability to move

blobs, blob versions, and blob snapshots to a cooler storage tier if not accessed or modified for a period of time to optimize for cost.

The following moves are possible:

Hot to Cool

Hot to Archive

Cool to Archive

Pricing

The lifecycle management feature is available for General Purpose v2 (GPv2) accounts, blob storage accounts, Premium Block Blob storage accounts, and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 accounts.

The lifecycle management feature is free of charge.

The only charge is the regular operation cost for the Set Blob Tier API calls required for the move.
